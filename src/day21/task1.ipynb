    "Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to learn from data instead of programming them with fixed rules. In traditional programming, the programmer writes explicit instructions to solve a problem, and the computer follows those rules to produce results. However, in Machine Learning, the computer is given examples of input data along with the correct output, and it automatically learns patterns and relationships from the data. Based on this learning, the computer can make predictions or decisions when new data is provided. This makes Machine Learning very useful for tasks such as prediction, classification, recommendation systems, and automation, where writing exact rules is difficult."
